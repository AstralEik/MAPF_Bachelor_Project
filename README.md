# MAPF_Bachelor_Project
This repository is for my bachelor project in software development at ITU, Measuring & Comparing the performance of modern MAPF algorithms, it revolves around trying to understand, code and empirically test the latest algorithms within the field of Multi-Agent Pathfinding Algorithms.

It focuses on using Roni Stern et al.'s framework, Multi-Agent Pathfinding: Definitions, Variants, and Benchmarks, found here: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/article/view/18510/18301, to empirically test some of the latest developments within the field.

Furthermore, this project hones in on the sub-optimal part of the research enviroment, since I have a major interest in game development, and these algorithms are an extremely interesting subject specifically for developing pathfinding AI's for videogames within genres such as RTS(Real-time strategy).

The algorithms that i have determined to be 'state of the art' researching the research space (Actually a suspiciously hard thing to do, seeing as every single successful and cited paper ever published in the space since the 2000's all declare themselves to be the state of the art), and will focus on reaching through this project, are these:

Greedy Priority-Based Search for Suboptimal Multi-Agent Path Finding, By Shao-Hung Chan et al., found here: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/article/view/27278/27051

EECBS: A Bounded-Suboptimal Search for Multi-Agent Path Finding, By Jiaoyang Li et al., found here: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17466

MAPF-LNS2: Fast Repairing for Multi-Agent Path Finding via Large Neighborhood Search, By Jiaoyang Li et al., found here: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/21266
